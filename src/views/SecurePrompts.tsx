                { key: 'B', text: "I'm preparing a presentation for our client, NovaTech. Here are their sales projections for next year, which we're including: $12 million in Q1, $15 million in Q2. Please make this look appealing and professional." },
                { key: 'C', text: "We're working on a new product we are about to propose to our company. Here is a draft of our explanation of it and its features. Could you make this sound more polished?" },

            feedback: "Choice A is incorrect as it includes confidential information including: financials, product details, and product features. Choice B is incorrect as this includes information about private company financials. Choice C is incorrect as here you pass in information about the product and its features which leaks private company information not made public yet. Choice D - Correct! Information here is intentionally kept vague yet still allows a good outline/template to start the summary of the product"

Some of the information provided to you includes sensitive internal details that have not been officially disclosed yet.  How might you use Chat GPT to help WITHOUT LEAKING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION?",

            ],
            correctAnswer: 'C',
            feedback: "Choice A is incorrect. GPT will keep information you feed it so detailing a donation that hasn't been announced potentially leaks this info. Choice B is incorrect. Information passed in is too specific and gives away details meant to be kept private. Choice C is correct, as information is kept vague and guides GPT to a useful output."
